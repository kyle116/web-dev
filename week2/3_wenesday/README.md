## Libraries and Frameworks
Read this to understand the differences between the 2: https://www.programcreek.com/2011/09/what-is-the-difference-between-a-java-library-and-a-framework/

## jQuery
jQuery is a JavaScript library. jQuery has almost become a standard to know along with the JavaScript language. Read more on this here:

https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp

jQuery has a couple different uses. The jQuery library contains the following features:

* HTML/DOM manipulation
* CSS manipulation
* HTML event methods
* Effects and animations
* AJAX
* Utilities

We will only be using the first 4 bullet points for now. Since jQuery is a library, it will have predefined content. To get this, we need to make it available for our project through script tags in our HTML file. We can do this 2 different ways.

Download the file and link it like a normal JavaScript file:
```
<head>
<script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

Or Copy the CDN link from a website that hosts jQuery like Google:
```
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

## jQuery Exercises
Complete the exercises in this [folder](https://github.com/kyle116/web-dev/tree/master/week2/3_wenesday/dom-exercise). It is the same as the DOM Manipulation exercises but instead of doing this with plain JavaScript, we will do the same exercises using jQuery. Make sure not to mix JavaScript methods with jQuery elements and vice versa because they will most likely cause errors.
