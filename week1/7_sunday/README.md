### JavaScript Code Challenges
Now that you have gotten some JavaScript experience, time to put it to the test. The following are challenges to complete. If the instructions are a bit hard to understand, they were meant to be that way! Not every thing in programming will be straight forward and be easy to understand.

Feel free to use an online JavaScript console such as:
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/)
* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)

Or use the Google Chrome's built JavaScript console by typing in `about:blank` in your URL bar. It is important to go on this page because other web pages may have interfering JavaScript that may affect the outcome of your code. Bring up the console by pressing `Command + Option + j` or `F12` key.

For each challenge, console.log the result.

#### Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
Write a program that prompts a user input and reads a Celsius degree, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the result. The formula for the conversion is as follows:

`fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32`

#### Which January starts on a Sunday between a range of years
Write a program to find which January begins on a Sunday between 2014 and 2050.

**Expected Output:**
`January starts on Sunday in year:  2017
January starts on Sunday in year:  2023
January starts on Sunday in year:  2034
January starts on Sunday in year:  2040
January starts on Sunday in year:  2045`

#### Check 2 integers and determine positive or negative
