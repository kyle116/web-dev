### JavaScript Code Challenges
Now that you have gotten some JavaScript experience, time to put it to the test. The following are challenges to complete.

Feel free to use an online JavaScript console such as:
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/)
* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)

Or use the Google Chrome's built JavaScript console by typing in `about:blank` in your URL bar. It is important to go on this page because other web pages may have interfering JavaScript that may affect the outcome of your code. Bring up the console by pressing `Command + Option + j` or `F12` key

For each challenge, console.log the result. 

#### Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
Write a program that prompts a user input and reads a Celsius degree, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the result. The formula for the conversion is as follows:

fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32
