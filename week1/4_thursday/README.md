### Using Terminal, GitHub, Markdown, Text Editor/IDE:
#### GitHub: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
**First what is Git?**
**Git** is the distributed version control system. Git is responsible for keeping track of changes to content (usually source code files), and it provides mechanisms for sharing that content with others.

**Now what is GitHub?**
**GitHub** is a company that provides Git repository hosting. If your team has a shared repository on GitHub, you could conceivably use GitHub without ever looking at its website. But, the website provides a lot of value on top of the core Git repository.

There are also other Git repository hosting sites, GitHub is just one of them. Others like BitBucket and ProjectLocker also do Git repository hosting. Each hosting site have different price plans. Feel free to take a look at the different ones.

**What is Markdown?**
(From: https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/)

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax for writers. It allows you to quickly write structured content for the web, and have it seamlessly converted to clean, structured HTML.

Back in 2004, Apple pundit John Gruber came up with the idea after becoming frustrated by writing long, laborious HTML tags to properly format his content. He devised a simple writing system which would make web based documents both easier to write, and easier to read in their raw state.

Hereâ€™s a quick example of Markdown in action:

`The *quick* brown fox, jumped **over** the lazy [dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog).`

becomes

The *quick* brown fox, jumped **over** the lazy [dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog).

Markdown is used in several different websites. Reddit comments and posts make use of this formatting. GitHub README files are written in Markdown often times, like the one you're reading now.

#### Text Editor/IDE:
There are many Text Editors and IDEs (Integrated development environment) out there. There are ones created specifically for certain languages. Some that have all types of tools and add ons and some that have almost nothing. Whatever you like, you may use if you have experience with it but we will be using:

**[Atom](https://atom.io/)**

Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows with support for plug-ins written in Node.js, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub. Atom has tons of support and packages that you can install to help with your coding needs.
